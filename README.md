# regression_case_study_tractors: Predicting the Prices of Tractors at Auction

## Summary
In this case study three partners and I used linear regression predict tractor prices at auction from sales data. As this was our first foray into the world of case studies, the learning curve was steep. Here is what I learned.

#### 1) Time management is crucial
This might seem obvious for a project with a time limit of 6 hours, but my group and I struggled deciding how much time to allot to each planning, data cleaning, model building, and managing git. In the same vein, several of us would end up doing the same task, leading to wasted time. This lack of coordination leads to the second lesson...

##### 1.5) It's worth the time to create a timeline
Related to time management, having a group discussion about the timeline of a project helps to ensure that your project will be finished in time. This is especially important when you're on deadline. 

#### 2) Task assignment is worth the discussion
It may not always be obvious who is working on each task in a project unless your group makes a point to discuss it. Task assignments are important because it ensures no one's work is redundant. As first time case studiers, my group was awash in redundancies and none of us were happy about it. 

#### 3) Start predictions much earlier than you think is necessary
My group took such a long time cleaning our data that by the time we were ready to build, test, and predict with our model we had a mere 2 hours on the clock! This obviously lead to sub-optimal models and predictions and no time to fix them. 

## Finally...
Overall, I would call this case study as success, even though it felt like a failure at the time. Based on what my partners and I learned from this project, my second case study (predicting the churn rate from a ride-sharing company) went about a thousand times smoother.
